# Decentralized Model Predictive Control for Increased Autonomy in Fleets of ROVs

## Denne m√• fylles ut etterhvert

This is the repository connected to a Bachelors thesis from NTNU in 2023.

The Python toolbox [do-mpc](https://www.do-mpc.com/en/latest/) was used for the MPC controller.

### REQUIREMENTS

To be able to run all code in this repository these programs are needed:

- [Ubuntu 22.04.2 LTS (Jammy Jellyfish)](https://releases.ubuntu.com/jammy/): OS for running ROS 2 and Gazebo Garden

- [ROS 2 Humble](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/index.html): Software for system arcetecture and comunication

- [Gazebo Garden](https://gazebosim.org/docs/garden/install_ubuntu): Simulation software

- [do-mpc](https://www.do-mpc.com/en/latest/): Python toolbox used for the MPS controller (for running the Python simulator, only do-mpc is required)

-  BlueRov2 plugin: Gazebo Garden plugin for ROV simulation model

### CONTENT

#### Gazebo simulator

Contains the code made by the group connected to the Gazebo simulator.

To run this simulator all [REQUIREMENTS](https://github.com/lrfosso/TowardsUnderwaterAutonomousFleets#requirements) must be installed.

Steps to run this simulator from terminal:

1. Navigate to the **\bluerov2_garden** workspace were the **\src** folder is located

2. Source ROS 2 install: **source /opt/ros/humble/setup.bash**

3. Build worspace: **colcon build**

4. Source install: **source install/setup.bash**

5. Navigate to the [params.yaml](https://github.com/lrfosso/TowardsUnderwaterAutonomousFleets/blob/main/GazeboSimulator/mpc_controller/params/params.yaml) file and set **n_multi_agent** parameter to the amount of agent you wish to spawn into the simulator.

6. The simulator is now ready to launch. It can be launched with one or multiple agents_

   - Single-agent launch:
     - Run command: **ros2 launch bluerov_launch bluerov_launch.py**

   -  Multi-agent launch:
      - Run command: **ros2 launch bluerov_launch bluerov_launch.py multi_agent:=4** (***NB***: The last number is the number of agents spawned and has to match the amount in [params.yaml](https://github.com/lrfosso/TowardsUnderwaterAutonomousFleets/blob/main/GazeboSimulator/mpc_controller/params/params.yaml) file)

7. Run command: **python3 mpc_controller.py**

Gazebo Garden and a GUI should have launched at this point. Start the simulation in Gazebo Garden with the play button in the lower left corner.

#### Python simulator(Do-mpc simulator)

Contains the code made by the group connected to the do-mpc simulator.


#### dataresultat

Contains the results from the simulation tests conducted during the project.
